</strong></div><br><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>The website you have entered (its sub-domains, affiliated websites, and any services available therefrom, including any mobile versions of the website or mobile applications) (the “Site”) is operated by The Forward Digital, LTD; The Forward Digital, LTD; and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates (“we” or “us”). We respect your privacy rights and recognize the importance of protecting data collected from you and about you. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how we collect, use, share, and protect that data.
</div><div>If you do not accept and agree with this Privacy Policy, you must stop using the Site immediately. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.
</div><br><div><br></div><div><strong>1. Collection of Data 
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;a. We collect personal data when you voluntarily provide it to us.
